# Rice Cooker

Rice cooker is an application that simulates the use of a rice cooker.

You need to follow the tool's standard operating procedures to avoid making any error.

The standard steps are:

- 1- Plug in the rice cooker
- 2- Put something on to cook
- 3- Start the rice cooker
- 4- Empty rice cooker
- 5- Switch off
- 6- Unplug rice cooker

Be careful, for example, if you start the rice cooker without putting anything in it, you'll get an error.
